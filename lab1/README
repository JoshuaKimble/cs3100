Students:

/var/classes/cs3100/lab1/cuke.tar contains the testing scripts I use to test your Lab 1.
This file is a work in progress, so be gentle and kind.

If your current working directory contains your wsh.cpp, wsh.h and Makefile,
issue command "tar xvf /var/classes/cs3100/lab1/cuke.tar" to extract three
folders, features, tmp and bin in to your current directory.

Then issue command "cucumber" to compile and exercise your wsh.
